# 📚 Academic Research Paper Navigator

> *"Chat with papers, map ideas, and accelerate your lit review."*

## 🚀 Overview

**Academic Research Paper Navigator** is an intelligent assistant for researchers, students, and academic professionals. It allows users to upload or fetch research papers (PDFs or arXiv links), get auto-generated summaries, visualize citation-based idea maps, and interact with papers using semantic Q\&A—all while curating personal insights over time.

### 🔍 Core Features

* **📄 Paper Ingestion**

  * Upload PDFs or fetch directly from [arXiv API](https://arxiv.org/help/api/index).
  * Extract metadata (title, authors, abstract, publication date).
  * Identify and highlight sections (Abstract, Methodology, Results, etc.) using NLP heuristics.

* **🧠 Semantic Search + Q\&A (via RAG)**

  * Build a vector index from paper content using **ChromaDB** or **FAISS**.
  * Ask research-specific questions (e.g., "What is the main contribution?" or "How does it compare with XYZ?").
  * Uses **LangChain** with models like **OpenAI GPT**, **Mistral**, or **Phi-3** for reasoning.

* **🗺️ Citation-Based Mind Mapping**

  * Extract citations using **PyMuPDF** or **Grobid**.
  * Construct a **temporal knowledge graph** using **NetworkX** and visualize it with **PyVis**, **D3.js**, or **Mermaid.js**.
  * Highlight thematic clusters (e.g., foundational papers vs. recent breakthroughs).

* **👥 CrewAI Agents for Modular Research Tasks**

  * 📚 **Literature Scout Agent**: Fetches related papers based on topic keywords.
  * 📝 **Summarizer Agent**: Generates concise TL;DR, highlights limitations, and contributions.
  * 🤖 **Q\&A Tutor Agent**: Answers technical questions from paper using semantic retrieval.
  * 🧭 **Map Curator Agent**: Updates and lays out citation maps with topic clusters.
  * 🧠 **Insight Archivist Agent**: Stores personalized notes and highlights.
  * 🔄 **Updater Agent**: Checks for newer papers or citations weekly (like a mini research digest).

* **🧑‍🎓 Personalization**

  * Users can embed their own notes and have the system learn from preferences (e.g., preferred topics, authors).
  * Track "read" vs "to-read" papers.
  * Tagging system for organizing ideas, authors, journals.

* **🧪 Experimental Features**

  * Claim extraction using factuality-check LLMs (extracting statements like "We propose..." or "Our results show\...").
  * Paper-to-slide generator: Convert key content into a presentation outline (using markdown/PPTX generation).
  * GPT/phi-based dialogue agents simulating the paper’s authors or peer reviewers.
